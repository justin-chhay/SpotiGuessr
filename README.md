## Navigating through the App
<div>
    <p>
    Upon login, you must authenticate your Spotify account as it is required for SpotiGuessr to be able to access your playlist data and user information. Keep in mind a premium account is required to allow playback of audio through the API!

In the game, you may need to first transfer the playback from your personal device to SpotiGuessr so it can play audio. Pressing play will play a short audio clip of a song from your personal playlist, from where you will need to guess the song within the search bar. You have multiple attempts!
